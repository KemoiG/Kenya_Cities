It became the capital of British East Africa in 1907 and after independence in 1963, it remained as the capital of Kenya. The name 'Nairobi' comes from the Maasai phrase 'Enkare Nairobi', which means 'cool water'."

The city was controlled by various powers including the Portuguese, Omani Arabs, and the British before Kenya's independence."

                info: "Kisumu, founded in 1901, was originally named Port Florence. It served as a key internal port linking the railway from Mombasa with steamships on Lake Victoria. The name 'Kisumu' comes from the Luo word 'sumo' which means a place of barter trade."

                info: "Nakuru, established in 1904, grew around the railway station. The name comes from the Maasai word 'Nakurro', meaning 'dust' or 'dusty place'. It's known for its nearby flamingo-filled lake and was an important administrative center during the colonial period."

                info: "Eldoret was founded in 1910 by Afrikaner settlers from South Africa. The name 'Eldoret' is based on the Maasai word 'eldore' meaning 'stony river', referring to the Sosiani River. It became a municipality in 1958 and has grown to be an important agricultural and industrial center."
